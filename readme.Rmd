This repository contains the code supporting the exemplar analysis, demonstrating the utility of genotyped trios in MoBa, performed for this paper. Scripts are organised into the following folders:

 - data-prep-universal (code to prepare data for all analyses)
 - trio-GWAS (code to perform trio-GWAS, estimate SNP h2s and rGs)
 - pgs-analyses (code to perform trio PGS and PTDT analyses)
 - trio-GCTA (code to perform trio GCTA analyses)
 - plotting (code to generate plots from the manuscript)

Code for the QC pipeline presented in the first part of the manuscript is available [here](https://github.com/psychgen/MoBaPsychGen-QC-pipeline).
